<h1>Flickr Titles</h1>

This is a JavaScript app orginally created as a class assignment in Hack University's Summer 2016 JavaScript Foundations class.

Once a user enters a search term, the app makes an AJAX call to the Flickr API and uses the url and metadata returned to render to the page the 100 most recently uploaded matching images. The titles of the photo files are overlayed, and the overlay is toggled on click.
