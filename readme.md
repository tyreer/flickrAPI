This is a JavaScript app created as a class assignment in Hack University's JavaScript Foundations class.

The app makes two separate calls to the Flickr API on click events.

Initially a user can search for terms on Flickr. This will result in a list of file titles being displayed.

When a file name is clicked, it will display the image as well as a bit of additional info about the photo.
